NOSQL Databases Your Ultimate Guide to the Non-Relational Universe! [including a historic Archive 2009-2011] News Feed covering some changes here ! NoSQL DEFINITION: Next Generation Databases mostly addressing some of the points: being non-relational, distributed, open-source and horizontally scalable. The original intention has been modern web-scale databases. The movement began early 2009 and is growing rapidly. Often more characteristics apply such as: schema-free, easy replication support, simple API, eventually consistent / BASE (not ACID), a huge amount of data and more. So the misleading term "nosql" (the community now translates it mostly with "not only sql") should be seen as an alias to something like the definition above. [based on 7 sources, 15 constructive feedback emails (thanks!) and 1 disliking comment . Agree / Disagree? Tell me so!
